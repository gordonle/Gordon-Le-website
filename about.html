			<h1>I am..</h1>
			<p>a brother, a son, a Scorpio, and probably some other things too. I'm from the beautiful city of Ottawa, Ontario, where I was born and raised. I completed the International Baccalaureate Program at Colonel By Secondary School, and now I'm attending the University of Waterloo, studying Computer Science.</p>
			<p>I am trilingual, and can speak English, French and Cantonese. I am also passionate about many things, as you'll soon find out below.</p>

			<h1>I have..</h1>
			<p>a pet turtle; her name is Walle. When I first got her, she was around the size of a tooney - now shes grown to the size of my hand.  </p>

			<h1>I love..</h1> <!-- INTRO -->
			<p>my family, my friends, and all those that have given me guidance or help so that I can be where I am today. From the bottom of my heart, thank you. </p>
			<!-- VOLUNTEERING -->
			<p>I also love to volunteer. <a href="https://gacsn.org/" class="button-text" target="_blank"><strong>GACSN</strong></a> is a program for children with special needs, and volunteering there has taught me friendship, patience, love, and most of all has brought a unique sense of fulfillment to my life. </p>
			<!-- MUSIC -->
			<p>Along with that, I also love <strong>music</strong>. I have been playing music ever since I was very young, and my passion for it has only grown. In the 10th grade I started a small band with two of my friends, Curtis Lei and Jessica Liu. My first term at UW was also my first term as a member of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/waterboysacappella" class="button-text" target="_blank"><strong>The Water Boys</strong></a>, an all-male A Cappella group. On the side, I continue to create my own music, posting covers of some of my favourite songs <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCq4JT5D7WYhkigmbVkBvUYA" class="button-text" target="_blank"><strong>here!</strong></a></p>
			<!-- SPORTS -->
			<p>Lastly, I love to play badminton, swim, play ultimate frisbee, and workout. In high school, I played badminton competitively, and I was the captain of both the Ultimate Frisbee and Swim teams. My love for swimming transferred into pursuing a part-time job as a Swim Instructor and Lifeguard.</p>
